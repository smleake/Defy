# Defy, a Free Dictionary/Thesaurus Discord Bot

A discord bot that is a fun project that enabled me to develop a deeper understanding of JS and working closely with API's.<br>
This project is bound to have bugs and faulty error handling but I personally think it's a great first iteration that can be improved upon and scaled as need.<br>
The project is also handicapped by api call limits/hour but that requires money (which I wouldn't mind paying out of pocket to keep it free, it's just not at that level to where it's required yet) <br>
Huge shoutout to <a href="https://github.com/advaith1/dictionary"> advaith1's dictionary bot! </a> It was a great reference and starting point.<br>\
